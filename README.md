Hello, I'm devcomfort. <br>
I've been programming since 2013, building expertise across frontend, backend, databases, infrastructure, and the broader development landscape. <br>
I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in AI Convergence at GIST (Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology), where I'm actively engaged in AI research.

**Primary Research Interests**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Multi-Agent Systems

I also have experience with domains such as Graph Representation, Graph Neural Networks, Representation Learning, Tabular Representation Learning, and Procedural Content Generation through graduation research, internships, newsletters, and papers. Feel free to reach out regardless of the field—I'm always open to discussions.

Over the past 12 years of programming, I've continuously explored ways to innovate both UX and DX. <br>
As a result, I've recently developed and maintained open-source libraries and CLI tools including [@devcomfort/text-transcoder](https://github.com/devcomfort/devcomfort-text-transcoder), [blob-to-url](https://github.com/devcomfort/blob-to-url), and Ubuntu Disk Toolkit.
